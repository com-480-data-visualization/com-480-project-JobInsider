## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

We use [LinkedIn Job Postings (2023 - 2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings) that is publicly avaliable from Kaggle. Below is an exerpt from the dataset discription:

> This dataset contains a nearly comprehehsive record of 124,000+ job postings listed in 2023 and 2024. Each individual posting contains dozens of valuable attributes for both postings and companies, including the title, job description, salary, location, application URL, and work-types (remote, contract, etc), in addition to separate files containing the benefits, skills, and industries associated with each posting. The majority of jobs are also linked to a company, which are all listed in another csv file containing attributes such as the company description, headquarters location, and number of employees, and follower count.
>
> With so many datapoints, the potential for exploration of this dataset is vast and includes exploring the highest compensated titles, companies, and locations; predicting salaries/benefits through NLP; and examining how industries and companies vary through their internship offerings and benefits.

### Problematic

How is the job market perspective for a job seeker currently? This is a question that especially vital to us young graduates. 

The motivation behind this data visualization project is to provide insights into the evolving job market, helping individuals and organizations understand which job titles, locations, and industries are experiencing the highest demand, as well as how compensation and benefits are distributed across different sectors. The analysis will also explore the prevalence of remote work and how companies differ in their internship offerings and employee benefits.



### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
